I founded [MFEK](https://github.com/MFEK/docs) (“Modular Font Editor K”) project,¹ help work on [FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge) and [SILE](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile) sometimes, and have worked on a bunch of fonts. My [personal website](https://ctrlcctrlv.github.io) lists those better.

Best way to contact is always email, at left.
